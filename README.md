# FFXIII-2 Music Mod
This is a mod that will reduce that music volume of all FFXIII-2 (probably FFXII) music

Install details are listed in install.txt

There is not too much code that I actually made (just the batch file and the small c file that handles converting a hex number). I also used ff13tool, ffxiiicrypt and xxd.

Hopefully this is useful for others!
